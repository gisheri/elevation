# Assessment Exercise Scenario

A client has requested an application that will display their different church groups to their users. They also would like to be able to filter the groups if possible.

## Objectives:

- Create an API using Laravel1 (PHP) or Loopback.io2 (Node.js) with a single endpoint (`/groups`) that will be used to list the various groups.
- Create a React frontend application that will use the API to display group information to the user.

## Expectations:

- API endpoint should return a JSON object representing the various groups.
- You should be able to send a request to the endpoint using a tool like Postman and see a successful response returned

## Bonus:

- Use Docker to build the image of your application
- Add an option for the end-user to be able to filter the various groups according to preference
- Use Typescript / ES6
- Use Redux
